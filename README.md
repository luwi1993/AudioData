# AudioML

This repository consists of a set of python scripts for loading, preprocessing, and extracting audio features from raw wav files. There are some models for prediction/generation from/of audio features. The folder SoundClasses contains a hirachy of modules for audio processing ranging from IO operations to building of a dataset in the pytorch dataloader format. There are some extra features for visualization. An example process is started in the Main.py script. Parameters can be configured using the hyperparams.py file.
